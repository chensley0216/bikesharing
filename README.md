Bikesharing Analysis

<b>Overview</b>
The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether or not a bikesharing program in Des Moines is feasable for the client and to further convince investors to pursue the project.  By gathering data on a bikisharing program in New York City, we can create a gameplan for how to best start a bikesharing program in Des Moines.


<b>Results</b>

<i>Top Starting Locations</i><br>
In this visual, we can see what areas of New York City had the greatest number of clients start biking, versus the fewest number. Using a size range and gradient color scale for each location, it is easier to understand the purpose of the visual.

<i>Top Ending Locations</i><br>
Using a gradient color scale and size range, we can see which locations had the greatest or fewest number of bikes turned in at the end of a client's use.

<i>Checkout Times</i><br>
This visual shows how many bikes were checked out by each descriptive group of individuals and for how long.

<i>Checkout Times by Gender</i><br>
With an additional filter added, we can see that each descriptive group represents a gender, and by coloring each line we can better understand the purpose of the line chart. The most bikes checked out were used by males.

<i>Trips by Weekday</i><br>
Using a color gradient, we can see at what days and times bikes were checked out the most.  The darker the color block, the more bikes were used.

<i>Trips by Gender</i><br>
This chart is very similar to the Trips by Weekday chart, though by separating by gender, we now have three charts to consider.  Based on the color blocks, we can see that males had the highest number of bikes used, especially on Thursdays during the hour blocks of 5 and 6 PM.

<i>User Trips by Gender</i><br>
By condensing the blocks to simply weekdays and not individual hours, we can have a better understanding of which genders used bikesharing more often.  Based on the data and the color scale, males used bikesharing the most, especially on Thursdays.

<b>Summary</b>
Based on the data provided, we can see that bikesharing is most commonly used by males during the week in the evenings.  Using this data, we can determine the best course of action in creating a bikesharing program in Des Moines, by targeting the male population with weekly opportunities to check out bikes. Two additional charts to add for a better understanding of the analysis would be Top Starting Locations by Gender and Top Ending Locations by Gender.  Determining where the most women or men checkout a bike can help create a foundation for the program in Des Moines by targeting specific genders in similar areas.
